# simple-popup

This is a simple popup built in ES6 in OOP/SPA fashion and compiled to vanilla js with babel.

A few Usage notes
1. The php file needs to be served up on a server
2. To run this just load the index.html on the browser. The index.html is already pointing to the build/app.js file/
3. The es6 code under /src is compiled with babel using npm run build. To make it easier to use out of the box, I commited the build directory.
4. If you'd like to run the build you'll need to run npm install and then npm run build.
